# ADR-0004: Hello-World Deployment

## Status

Accepted — hosting product amended by [ADR-0090](./0090-frontend-hosting-workers-static-assets.md) (Pages → Workers static assets); the deploy/promotion/rollback shape described here still applies.

## Context

The project has accumulated three architectural ADRs and a frontend scaffold
(PR #7) but has never been deployed. Per `MANIFESTO.md`, "CI is the only path
to production" and "Rollback is always one click" — both of which require an
actual production target to exist. Per ADR-0001 §7, deployment-target choices
require an ADR merged before any implementation.

This ADR is intentionally scoped to the *hello-world* deployment: prove the
pipeline end-to-end with the smallest credible target. Real product surfaces
(JVM service, OpenAPI-driven HTTP layer, persistent storage, multiplayer)
will each get their own deployment ADR when they are introduced.

What exists today and is therefore deployable:

- The `frontend/` bounded context (PR #7) — Vite + React + Panda CSS,
  produces a static bundle (`pnpm build`) of ~95 KB gzipped. Renders one
  route at `/` with the heading "Bliss".
- The `grid/` JVM context — domain and infrastructure layers only. There is
  **no HTTP entry point**, no `application/`, no `api/`. Adding one is
  itself a new bounded-context-layer workstream.

The selection space considered for v1:

- **What gets deployed first:** the frontend static bundle, a new JVM
  hello-world service, or both.
- **Where:** Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Render,
  Fly.io, Railway, AWS App Runner, GCP Cloud Run, self-hosted.
- **How:** GitHub Actions driving the platform's deploy mechanism, IaC
  parameters in repo, container or buildpack-based artifacts.

## Decision

### 1. What is deployed first: the frontend static bundle

Only the `frontend/` static bundle is deployed in v1. The JVM service is
*not* deployed yet.

Rationale:
- The frontend is the only thing currently producing a deployable artifact.
  Deploying a JVM service requires first introducing an HTTP entry point
  (`grid/application/`, `grid/api/`, plus the framework choice deferred in
  ADR-0003 §3) — that is a separate workstream and a separate ADR.
- A static bundle deploys in seconds and exercises the full pipeline
  (CI build → artifact → platform → live URL → rollback) without dragging
  in the JVM cold-start question, the framework choice, or the database
  question.
- Per `MANIFESTO.md` ("Right-sized infra. Tear down unused environments."),
  shipping nothing JVM-side until there is a JVM endpoint to ship is the
  honest move.

A follow-up ADR will introduce the JVM hello-world deployment when the first
HTTP endpoint exists. The two deployments will then run side-by-side; the
frontend pipeline established here is the template.

### 2. Where it deploys: Cloudflare Pages

Cloudflare Pages is the v1 target. Trade-offs honestly considered:

- **Free tier covers everything.** Unlimited bandwidth, 500 builds/month,
  unlimited preview deployments. No credit card required for the project's
  foreseeable footprint.
- **French audience presence.** Cloudflare has POPs in Paris (CDG) and
  multiple secondary French cities; latency to French users is competitive
  with any provider, better than US-anchored ones.
- **PR preview deployments out of the box.** Every PR opened against `main`
  gets its own ephemeral URL. This satisfies the manifesto's "Same IaC for
  ephemeral, staging, and production — parameterized, not duplicated."
- **GitOps native.** Pages is wired to a Git provider; pushing `main`
  triggers a production build and deploy. The repo is, in fact, the source
  of truth for system state.
- **Workers integration.** When a JVM-or-edge backend is needed later,
  Cloudflare Workers (or external JVM hosting fronted by Workers) is one
  configuration step away.
- **Vendor lock-in.** Real but bounded: a static bundle is portable to any
  static host with a few lines of CI change. The IaC config (`wrangler.toml`)
  is small and replaceable. Acceptable for a sandbox.
- **Manifesto rule "Container images pinned to digest. Builds are
  deterministic."** Static bundles are not container images, so the digest-
  pinning rule does not apply directly. The deterministic-build half is
  honored via `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` plus a pinned Node version
  in `.nvmrc` and the GitHub Actions `setup-node` step.

Rejected alternatives:

- **Vercel** — comparable feature set, but the project explicitly chose
  Vite over Next.js (ADR-0002 §1). Vercel's value-add over Cloudflare
  Pages is mostly Next.js integration, which is irrelevant here.
- **Netlify** — similar to Cloudflare Pages on features; lower free
  bandwidth ceiling, no clear edge-compute story for the JVM-eventually
  case. Slightly worse fit.
- **GitHub Pages** — no preview deployments per PR, no edge compute, no
  custom build pipeline. Too limited even for v1.
- **Fly.io / Render / Railway / Cloud Run / App Runner** — overkill for a
  static bundle; better fits for the *next* deployment ADR (the JVM
  service).
- **Self-hosted (a tiny VPS, Cloudflare Tunnel)** — adds maintenance burden
  with no offsetting gain at this stage.

### 3. How it deploys: GitHub Actions → Cloudflare Pages, schema in repo

The deployment is driven entirely by GitHub Actions. The Cloudflare Pages
project itself is declared as IaC in the repo (see Notes for the choice
between Terraform and a scripted bootstrap), so no manual platform clicks
are required to create it. The only one-time human steps are the
manifesto-permitted ones: a Cloudflare account exists (the platform
boundary above any per-project IaC), and the API-token *material* is
injected into GitHub Actions Secrets (per §7, secret values stay out of
the repo by design).

Concretely (the *implementation* of which lives in a follow-up workstream;
this ADR commits to the *shape*):

- `.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml` runs on push to `main` and on
  `pull_request` (for previews). Steps: `actions/checkout`,
  `actions/setup-node` pinned to the version in `frontend/.nvmrc`,
  `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm --filter frontend build`,
  `cloudflare/pages-action` to publish.
- Build artifacts are deterministic: lockfile committed, Node version
  pinned, no ambient state on the runner consulted.
- A `wrangler.toml` (or equivalent Pages config) lives in `frontend/` and
  is the source of truth for build settings the platform reads.
- Ephemeral environments per PR are provided by Pages automatically;
  production is the result of a push to `main` (per ADR-0001 §6,
  squash-merge only).

### 4. Promotion strategy: previews on PR, production on `main`

- **Ephemeral preview environment** — every PR against `main` gets a
  unique `pr-<n>.<project>.pages.dev` URL. Reviewers can click and play.
- **Production** — every merge to `main` triggers a production deploy.
- **Staging** — *not introduced in v1*. The manifesto's "Same IaC for
  ephemeral, staging, and production" is satisfied by ephemeral=production
  parity (same workflow, same build, same platform). When complexity
  warrants a staging tier (real users, real data), a future ADR adds it
  by parameterizing the existing workflow, not by duplicating it.

### 5. Rollback strategy: revert + redeploy, with platform fallback

- **Primary mechanism:** revert the offending commit on `main` (one PR,
  squash-merge, auto-redeploys via the workflow). Manifesto-conformant
  ("Rollback is always one click") and GitOps-pure (state is what the repo
  says).
- **Secondary mechanism:** Cloudflare Pages keeps deployment history. The
  Pages dashboard exposes a "Roll back to this deployment" button, useful
  if the offending commit is hard to revert (build broke, dependency
  poisoned). This is the escape hatch, not the default — using it
  introduces drift between repo state and live state.

### 6. Observability: minimum viable, OpenTelemetry deferred

The manifesto requires "structured logging (JSON), distributed tracing
(OpenTelemetry) from day 1, RED metrics on every service endpoint." For a
static frontend with no service endpoint, the literal reading does not
apply, but the spirit does:

- **v1 minimum:** Cloudflare Web Analytics (free, privacy-respecting,
  cookieless) enabled at the Pages project level. Captures page views,
  Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP), referrers, country buckets. No PII.
- **Browser-side error reporting** — deferred to the first interactive
  feature ADR. A static "display a title" page has no failure modes
  worth piping to Sentry / OTel.
- **OpenTelemetry browser SDK** — deferred. Cost-justified only when a
  request crosses the front/back boundary; with no API yet, there is no
  span to emit. The `frontend/src/infrastructure/telemetry/` slot is
  reserved by ADR-0002's hexagonal layout for when this lands.
- **Logs** — server-side logs do not exist (static deploy). The eventual
  JVM service ADR will reaffirm the manifesto's "structured JSON logs"
  rule.

This is a deliberate stretch of the manifesto's "OTel from day 1" wording.
Justification: OTel without a span to record is theater. The ADR-0002
slot for telemetry exists; it is wired the day there is something to
trace. The blameless-post-mortem rule kicks in if this stretch causes a
real incident.

### 7. Secret management: GitHub Actions secrets, with a git-side gate

- The single secret needed for v1 is the Cloudflare API token (scoped to
  the Pages project, no broader Cloudflare access).
- The *binding* — i.e. which secret names the deploy workflow consumes
  (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`), what they are scoped
  to, and which workflow step reads them — is documented in repo code
  (the workflow file itself plus this ADR). Only the secret *material* is
  injected at runtime via GitHub Actions Secrets, never committed.
- Secret values are referenced in the deploy workflow only; never in repo
  code.
- **Git-side secret-scanning gate (non-deferrable).** The manifesto rule
  "Git hooks prevent accidental commits" is binding from the moment any
  real secret enters the project's CI. The follow-up implementation
  workstream is the first to introduce such a secret (the Cloudflare
  token), so it must ship a `gitleaks` (or `detect-secrets`) pre-commit
  hook committed to the repo *and* a GitHub Actions check that runs the
  same tool on every PR. Both ship together in the deploy-implementation
  workstream, or as a prerequisite workstream that merges first —
  whichever the implementer finds cleaner. A broader security ADR (SAST,
  dependency review, etc.) may follow later, but the git-hook backstop
  is not deferrable to it.

### 8. What this ADR explicitly does not decide

- **JVM hello-world deployment** — separate ADR when the first HTTP
  endpoint exists.
- **Custom domain** — Cloudflare Pages's `*.pages.dev` subdomain is used
  in v1. Custom-domain decision (which domain, registrar, DNS strategy)
  belongs in a separate ADR alongside the first marketing/landing page.
- **Multi-region strategy** — Cloudflare Pages is multi-region by default
  via the global edge network; no per-region tuning needed at this stage.
- **Autoscaling tuning** — N/A for static; deferred to the JVM-service
  deployment ADR.
- **CDN cache headers beyond Pages defaults** — defaults are fine for a
  21 KB JS bundle; revisit when caching strategy materially affects
  perceived performance.
- **Pre-deploy security scanning** (SAST, dependency scanning) — covered
  by the project security ADR, not by deployment.
- **Disaster-recovery / backup strategy** — N/A for stateless static;
  reappears in the persistent-storage ADR.
- **Cost monitoring / budget alerts** — N/A on free tier; revisit if any
  paid feature is ever enabled.

## Consequences

### Easier

- The pipeline exists end-to-end on day one. Future workstreams ship by
  merging a PR; deploy-readiness becomes a property of the repo, not of a
  human ritual.
- Per-PR ephemeral environments make review faster and the §6a reviewer
  agent's job easier — it can quote a live URL when commenting on visual
  regressions.
- Rollback discipline is established before there is anything to roll
  back from. By the time a real incident happens, the muscle memory is
  there.
- The manifesto's GitOps rule is honored without extra tooling: pushing
  `main` is the deploy mechanism, full stop.

### Harder

- The OpenTelemetry stretch is real. The manifesto says "from day 1"; this
  ADR says "from the first request." If a future incident shows that
  observability gaps grew silently between deploys, the rule wins and an
  amendment narrows this ADR.
- Cloudflare lock-in is real. Migrating off Pages later is not free, and
  the Workers escape hatch we're banking on for the JVM-edge case may
  not match a JVM service's needs (Workers run V8, not JVM). A future ADR
  may pick a different host for the backend and front Pages with it.
- The single-host story breaks the moment we need the JVM service. The
  v2 deployment story will be two-platform unless we reconsider.

### Different

- "Production" stops being aspirational on this branch. Every PR has
  consequences for a live URL.
- The §6a reviewer's "obvious bugs" check now has a concrete artifact to
  inspect — the preview deployment — in addition to the diff. The role
  scope in ADR-0001 §6a does not change, but the data the reviewer can
  consult expands.
- Branch hygiene matters more (per ADR-0001 §2): a stale `claude/...`
  branch is now also a stale Pages preview. The workflow's cleanup step
  (Pages auto-deletes preview deploys when the PR closes) takes care of
  this without intervention.

## Notes

This ADR is revisited if any of the following occur:

- The free tier becomes insufficient (build minutes, bandwidth, or any
  Pages limit). Trigger to evaluate paid tiers or alternative hosts.
- A second deployment target is introduced (the JVM hello-world). The
  promotion / rollback / observability sections may need to harmonize
  across both.
- The OpenTelemetry deferral causes a real incident the SDK would have
  prevented or shortened. The "deferred" rule retires.
- Cloudflare materially changes the Pages product, pricing, or terms in a
  way that affects the project.
- The pre-commit secret-scanning gate proves insufficient (a leak slips
  through, or the tool is too noisy to keep enabled). Trigger to revisit
  scanner choice or add a server-side push-protection layer.

Implementation does not begin in this PR. The follow-up workstream
(`feat/deploy-frontend-cloudflare-pages` or similar) introduces:
- `.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml`.
- `frontend/.nvmrc`.
- `frontend/wrangler.toml` (or the equivalent Pages config).
- **The Cloudflare Pages project declared as IaC in the repo.** Two
  defensible options; the implementer picks one, neither is "manual":
  - *Preferred:* a Cloudflare Terraform provider configuration
    (`cloudflare_pages_project` resource, plus matching state backend)
    committed to the repo, applied from CI. Clearer audit trail, same
    pattern reusable when a second Cloudflare resource appears.
  - *Acceptable:* a scripted bootstrap target (e.g. a `Makefile` target,
    or a `scripts/bootstrap-pages-project.sh`) that invokes
    `wrangler pages project create` with all flags pinned, committed to
    the repo and idempotent. Lighter weight; fine while there is exactly
    one Cloudflare resource.
- **A `gitleaks` (or `detect-secrets`) pre-commit hook + matching
  GitHub Actions check**, both committed to the repo. Non-deferrable per
  §7 — this workstream is the first to introduce a real CI secret, so
  the git-side backstop ships with it (or as a prerequisite workstream
  that merges first).
- **Binding documentation for the deploy secrets.** The names
  `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, what they are
  scoped to, and where the workflow consumes them, are recorded in repo
  code (the workflow file plus a short note in `docs/`). The secret
  *values* are injected at runtime into GitHub Actions Secrets — that
  injection is the manifesto-permitted "secrets never in code, injected
  at runtime" path, not a manual *infrastructure* step.

A single bootstrap exception is called out explicitly per the manifesto's
"exceptions require explicit justification" rule: the Cloudflare *account*
itself (the entity that owns API tokens and Pages projects) exists above
any per-project IaC and is created once when the project signs up for
Cloudflare. This is a platform-tenancy boundary, not project
infrastructure, and is sunset the day the project moves off Cloudflare.

That follow-up is itself bounded by ADR-0001 §4 — single workstream,
single context, under 400 lines of hand-written code, conventional commits.
