# ADR-0039: Bitmask-CSP Grid Generator with Luby Restarts

## Status

Accepted

Supersedes ADR-0015.

## Context

ADR-0015 introduced a three-phase pipeline (Skeleton → SlotPlanner → SkeletonFiller)
to guarantee structural validity and inter-word interlocking. That design solved the
original greedy CSP's layout defects but exposed a different failure mode at production
grid sizes (15×12, min word length 2).

A Wave 1 25-generation benchmark (commit `670798a` on `feat/grid-gen-enhance`) revealed:

- **0/25 first-attempt successes** at 15×12 with the production French corpus.
- All 25 seeds produced the **identical slot plan** — `SlotPlanner` is fully
  deterministic post corpus-aware-length and MRV-arrow-ordering enhancements,
  so it always commits to the same plan for a given grid size.
- Every attempt spent the full 5 s deadline watching the filler confirm that the
  committed plan was unfillable (70 000+ backtracks per puzzle).

Root cause: `SlotPlanner` commits slot lengths without ever proving that the chosen
lengths are *collectively* fillable. The downstream `SkeletonFiller` then exhausts the
search tree for that plan before signalling failure. Because the plan is deterministic,
every retry sees the same unfillable plan and wastes the same 5 s. Production masked
this via the use-case retry loop (different seeds shuffle filler head order), but the
per-attempt success rate was effectively zero.

## Decision

Replace the three-phase pipeline with an **integrated bitmask-CSP** generator that
commits `(black-cell layout, slot length, word)` atomically, never producing a partial
plan that has not been shown extensible.

### Components

**`BlackCellLayout`** (replaces `Skeleton` + `SlotPlanner`)

A 5-pass stochastic procedure that seeds a `CellArray` with black cells satisfying:
- boundary slot convention (alternating black/letter on row 0 and column 0);
- no white run of length 1 (`minLen ≥ 2`);
- no white run longer than `lUseful` (the longest length with adequate corpus coverage);
- approximately `blackRatio` of cells are black.

Layout variability comes from `Random` — no deterministic plan is ever committed.
Perturbation at hot-slot midpoints replaces the old "try a new seed" retry strategy.

**`SlotRegistry`** (replaces `SlotPlanner` slot enumeration)

Reads a `CellArray` and materialises `Slot` objects (position, direction, length) with
their crossing constraints. Slots know their neighbours' crossing positions, which the
CSP uses for constraint propagation.

**`Lexicon`** (new)

Builds per-length, per-position letter-indexed bitmask domains from the `WordRepository`
at construction time. A domain is a `LongArray` where each bit corresponds to one word
in the corpus bucket; intersection constraints become bitwise AND operations, making
arc-consistency propagation O(⌈|domain|/64⌉) per slot per propagation step.

**`BitmaskCsp`** (replaces `SkeletonFiller`)

Standard DPLL-style backtracking CSP solver over `Slot` objects:

1. Initial AC-3 to fixed point before search begins.
2. Variable ordering: MRV (smallest live domain) + degree tie-break + random final
   tie-break.
3. Value ordering: sampled-window LCV (least-constraining value via forward-check of
   neighbours).
4. After each assignment, AC-3 cascade propagation.
5. On failure, undo via a `TrailEntry` log.
6. Stops on deadline, backtrack-budget exceeded, or explicit cancellation.

**`LubySequence`** / Luby restart schedule

`GridGenerator` runs a restart loop. Per-attempt backtrack budget follows the Luby
sequence (Luby/Sinclair/Zuckerman 1993): `1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, …`. This sequence is
provably near-optimal for Las Vegas algorithms with unknown runtime distribution,
minimising worst-case wasted work within O(log n) of the best fixed schedule.

On budget exhaustion or timeout, the generator perturbs the layout at hot-slot
midpoints; every `CONSEC_RESEED` consecutive failures triggers a full re-seed.

**`GridGenerator`** (rewritten)

Thin orchestrator: builds `Lexicon` once (lazy, cached), then runs the Luby restart
loop. The public `generate(constraints, random, metrics, timeoutMs, cooldownPolicy)`
signature is unchanged.

### What is removed

`Skeleton.kt`, `SlotPlanner.kt`, `PlanState.kt`, and `SkeletonFiller.kt` are deleted.
No flag-based coexistence is maintained; rollback is by reverting the implementation
commits on this branch.

## Alternatives considered

**Keep `SlotPlanner` but add diversity.** Introducing randomness into slot-length
selection was tried in earlier waves and produced marginal improvement. The root cause
is that any pre-committed plan that happens to be infeasible wastes the entire timeout;
diversity in plan selection cannot fix that without also validating each plan before
committing to it — which is what the integrated solver does.

**AC-3 as pre-processing only (not propagation).** Running AC-3 once before search
reduces domain sizes but does not help after assignments narrow intersecting domains.
Full incremental AC-3 after each assignment is retained.

**Conflict-directed backjumping (CBJ).** Deferred. Chronological backtracking with
Luby restarts handles the production corpus; CBJ should be revisited if a future
benchmark shows the backtrack depth as the next bottleneck.

## Consequences

### Easier

- First-attempt success rate at 15×12 is non-zero on every seed; the deterministic
  all-fail scenario is eliminated.
- Layout diversity is a natural consequence of word-choice propagating to slot-length
  decisions; no separate diversity knob is needed.
- Each component (`BlackCellLayout`, `SlotRegistry`, `Lexicon`, `BitmaskCsp`,
  `LubySequence`) is independently unit-testable with no external dependencies.

### Harder

- `BlackCellLayout`'s 5-pass procedure is more complex than the deterministic
  `Skeleton`; a wrong pass ordering can produce layouts with orphan white cells. The
  existing `BlackCellLayoutTest` suite verifies the structural invariants.
- The bitmask domain representation ties `Lexicon` to the word ordering established at
  build time; adding words after construction requires rebuilding the `Lexicon`.
- The Luby budget parameters (`BASE_BUDGET`, `CONSEC_RESEED` in `GenerationKnobs`)
  are empirically tuned to the French corpus. A corpus change may require re-tuning.

### Different

- `GridGenerator` is now a thin orchestrator; the search logic lives in `BitmaskCsp`,
  not spread across three loosely coupled phases.
- `AttemptOutcome` and `GenerationMetrics` (added to `GeneratePuzzleUseCase`) surface
  per-attempt backtrack counts and timing for observability; ADR-0015's pipeline had
  no equivalent instrumentation.

### Amendment (2026-07-01): white-cell connectivity + half-checked interlocking

Empirical measurement (see `GridConnectivityReproTest`) found the generator
produced a **closed block** — white cells split into a disconnected pocket by
black cells / the border — in ~11-14% of 15x12 grids, on both the current and
pre-scrub corpora (a long-standing latent defect, not a corpus regression).
`BlackCellLayout.canPlaceBlack` gains **Check 6**: a black placement is rejected
if it disconnects the white cells into more than one 4-connected region. Every
placement path (density sprinkle, run-capping, perturbation) routes through
`canPlaceBlack`, so this structurally forbids closed blocks (0% after the guard,
generation success ~95%, unchanged).

Interlocking is **half-checked**, not fully-checked: a letter cell in exactly one
word — sandwiched by black/border on the other axis — is valid mots fléchés,
interior or edge. `GridValidator.uncrossedCells` is relaxed accordingly to flag
only cells in *no* word (unfillable). The prior "interior cells must cross both"
rule was stricter than the genre requires and was never enforced during
generation; keeping it invited a footgun (enabling `enforceInterlocking` would
have rejected ~15% of valid grids).
