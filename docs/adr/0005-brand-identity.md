# ADR-0005: Brand Identity (WordSparrow)

## Status

Accepted. Superseded in part by ADR-0043 (§4 palette and §5 typography; §3a definition-cell rules and §6–7 remain active).

## Context

The project has shipped its hello-world deployment, the first OpenAPI
contract, and an interactive grid component. It now needs a real product
identity beyond the internal codename "Bliss":

- The maintainer has registered `wordsparrow.io` as the production domain.
- The `frontend/` static bundle currently renders `<h1>Bliss</h1>` and ships
  with PWA manifest fields, document title, and README copy still bound to
  the codename.
- The FSL-1.1-MIT license now has a real product name to protect.
- The audience is primarily French (mots fléchés is a French puzzle
  variant), so the brand must work in French even if the wordmark stays
  English.

This ADR records the brand identity so subsequent implementation work-
streams (theming, custom domain, marketing copy) have a single source of
truth. Per ADR-0001 §7, a project rename is non-trivial and requires an
ADR before the implementation PR.

The selection space considered:

- **Codename retirement vs. dual-name.**
- **Visual mood** across newspaper-classical, sharp-contemporary, and
  playful-mascot directions.
- **Logo timing** (DIY now vs. wait for a designer commission).
- **Typography** within free-licensed Google Fonts that support French
  diacritics.
- **Palette** committed to specific hex values rather than vague
  directions.

## Decision

### 1. Product name and codename retirement

- **Product name:** `WordSparrow` (one word, mixed case in prose, all
  lowercase in domain and identifier contexts: `wordsparrow.io`,
  `wordsparrow` package name).
- **Domain:** `wordsparrow.io` (registered).
- **Codename:** `Bliss` is retired. The repository, package identifiers,
  Cloudflare Pages project, Terraform variables, route copy, PWA manifest,
  README, and ADR cross-references all flip to WordSparrow in subsequent
  workstreams. Repo-level rename (`Ishou/bliss` → `Ishou/wordsparrow`) is
  its own workstream because it has GitHub-side coordination cost; this
  ADR commits to the intent so the rename is not relitigated each time
  the codename appears in a new file.
- **Pronunciation / spelling.** Always `WordSparrow` (no space, no
  hyphen). Lowercase forms (`wordsparrow`) only in machine identifiers.

### 2. Positioning and voice

- **Positioning:** modern *mots fléchés* and word puzzles, designed to
  feel as good on a phone as on paper, with a friendly tone that doesn't
  take itself too seriously.
- **Voice (English):** warm, direct, slightly cheeky. No corporate
  filler. Aligned with `CLAUDE.md`'s "no sycophancy" rule applied to
  user-facing copy.
- **Voice (French):** `tu` by default, casual app register (Duolingo-
  style), with optional `vous` if a later usability study shows it
  matters to the audience.
- **Inclusive language** per `MANIFESTO.md` Ethics: copy is gender-
  neutral by default, accessible language, no jargon-as-gatekeeping.

### 3. Visual mood: playful, Duolingo-direction

The visual identity leans **playful and warm** rather than newspaper-
classical or sharp-contemporary:

- Generous border-radii (rounded shapes everywhere, not sharp corners).
- Warm cream / white surfaces, not pure white.
- Vibrant primary that signals energy (coral, not corporate blue).
- Friendly rounded sans-serif typography, no serifs in v1.
- Celebratory micro-moments (color shifts on word completion) rather
  than minimalist neutrality.
- Subtle texture/depth via soft shadows; no skeuomorphism, no flat-only
  either.

Reference points: Duolingo, NYT Games (the warmer recent direction),
Wordscapes — adapted to a French *mots fléchés* sensibility (less
cartoon, no mascot animations in v1).

#### Amendment (PR #207, 2026-05-07): Twilight dark-theme pivot

The visual mood pivots from warm-cream playful to **dark and focused**:

- Neutral dark gray page (`aubergine` #1B1B1F) — recedes so the grid commands the eye.
- Sakura-rose grid surfaces: letter cells (`plum` #5E3450) sit one notch lighter than definition cells (`mauve` #4A2A40), so the input slot pops above the clue.
- Near-black block squares (`pitch` #0A0A0C) — the "void" square.
- Warm pink-white foreground text (`petal` #F5EAEC) — picks up the surface hue; passes AA on every grid surface.
- Brand green (`leaf`) remains primary; accent text shifts to `leaf.400` (#A2D481, ~10:1 on `aubergine`) since `leaf.700` falls below AA on dark backgrounds.

Warm-cream surfaces (`cream`, `sand`), pure-white fills (`breath`), and navy body text (`ink`) are superseded by the twilight primitives. **Dark mode is now the single visual theme for v1.** The §8 hold on dark mode is lifted; this pivot is the implementation.

### 3a. Definition cells: one or two clues per cell (amendment)

The first interactive grid (PR #21) simplified definition cells to **one
arrow each**, deferring the diagonal-split case as out-of-scope for v1.
Production review of the demo grid (PR #26) showed this simplification
makes a 5×5 *fully-interlocking* puzzle impossible without unrealistic
density: requiring one definition cell per clue forces every column to
be a single uninterrupted run, and 4–5-letter French words rarely
intersect cleanly enough for that to yield real words in both axes.

**Amendment.** A definition cell carries **one or two clues**. When two,
they are stacked vertically inside the cell — the right-arrow clue on
top, the down-arrow clue below — each with its own clue text and arrow
indicator. The order is fixed (right above down) so the renderer never
re-sorts and screen readers walk the clues in a stable order. The
diagonal-split visual variant remains deferred; stacked is sufficient
to support clean fully-interlocking grids.

WCAG: stacked clues drop one font step (~10 px) to fit two short French
clues per cell. The `sand` background against `ink` foreground is
13.6:1, well above the 4.5:1 AA bar at the smaller size; no extra
contrast work is required by this amendment.

**Amendment 2 (PR #96, 2026-04-29).** The boundary-skeleton pattern
introduced a second class of dual cell not covered above: *same-axis
duals*. Two cases arise at skeleton boundaries:

- **Top-row inner cells** (`row=0, col=2k`): `right-down + down` — both
  vertical.
- **Left-col inner cells** (`row=2k, col=0`): `down-right + right` — both
  horizontal.

For these cells the horizontal-first rule is undefined (there is no
horizontal clue when both are vertical, and no vertical clue when both
are horizontal). The domain mapping therefore preserves **API order** —
the order in which the cells appear in the `cells` array emitted by the
grid service. The "right above down" invariant from the original §3a
amendment applies exclusively to mixed-axis duals.

The type-level invariant `[DefinitionClue & { arrow: HorizontalArrow },
DefinitionClue & { arrow: VerticalArrow }]` has been intentionally
relaxed to `readonly [DefinitionClue, DefinitionClue]` to accommodate
same-axis pairs. Screen readers walk same-axis duals in API order;
future schema versions may pin this order explicitly if user-research
surfaces a concern.

Rendering caveat: `DefinitionCellView`'s two-clue branch still
hard-codes the right + down arrow icons. Visual polish to derive arrow
icons from each clue's actual axis is deferred to a follow-up workstream.

### 4. Color palette

Six tokens, committed to specific hex values. These are *named tokens*,
not raw hex; raw hex values appear in Panda config only. Implementation
workstream extends each into a 50–900 ramp.

| Token | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `leaf` (primary) | `#10B981` | Brand primary; CTAs, focused-cell ring, brand wordmark |
| `blossom` (accent) | `#E8A5B0` | Win states, badges, highlights |
| `cream` (surface) | `#FFFAF3` | Page background; the paper-like canvas |
| `sand` (subtle) | `#E5DCC6` | Cell dividers, blocked-cell fill, secondary borders |
| `ink` (foreground) | `#1B2845` | Body text, grid letters, primary headings |
| `breath` (white) | `#FFFFFF` | Letter-cell input background, floating-card surfaces |

Why these specific values:

- **`leaf #10B981`** is Tailwind's emerald-500 — vibrant and playful but
  in a different hue and saturation from Duolingo's `#58CC02`. Reads as
  "modern fresh" rather than "kindergarten green," and the slight
  teal-lean keeps it distinct from every generic SaaS green. Ramped to
  `leaf.700` for text-on-light contrast (≥ AA at body sizes).
- **`blossom #E8A5B0`** is a dusty rose, mid-saturation, warm-leaning.
  "Discret" was the brief: this is a small splash for win states and
  badges, not a co-primary that competes with `leaf`. Complementary
  enough to `leaf` to feel intentional, muted enough to recede.
- **`cream + sand`** stay warm and paper-like so the green + pink
  combination sits on a botanical / fresh-spring base rather than a
  cold corporate white.
- **`ink #1B2845`** (deep navy) gives text a softer landing than pure
  black on cream and works against both `leaf` and `blossom` without
  visual chord clashes.

**Accessibility constraint (WCAG AA):** `leaf` (#10B981) and `blossom`
(#E8A5B0) do not meet WCAG AA contrast against `breath` or `cream`
(~2.9:1 and ~1.8:1 respectively; minimums are 3:1 for UI components and
4.5:1 for text). Any element placing foreground content on a `leaf` or
`blossom` background **must** use `ink` (#1B2845) as the foreground
(~5.4:1, passes AA); white-on-leaf and white-on-blossom are excluded
from this palette. For text *colored* with the brand (`leaf` or
`blossom` foreground on `cream`/`breath`), use the darker ramp shades
(`leaf.700` or `blossom.700`) per the implementation workstream's Panda
ramp generation. The implementation workstream must verify contrast at
each brand-color usage site before shipping.

A small `signal` palette is reserved (added later, not in v1):
- `signal.error` — distinct from `blossom` so error states don't conflict
  with the accent.
- `signal.success` — distinct from `leaf` so success states pop
  separately from the primary brand.

Dark mode is **not** in scope for v1. Reasoning: the playful + warm
direction is harder to translate to dark surfaces without losing
character, and the manifesto's "Right-sized infra" / "no premature
features" applies to design too. Revisit when a real user requests it
or when night-time-puzzle telemetry justifies it.

#### Amendment (PR #207, 2026-05-07): Twilight palette tokens

The surface and foreground primitives (`cream`, `sand`, `ink`, `breath`) are superseded. The `leaf` and `blossom` ramps are retained unchanged. Six new primitives replace the four surface anchors:

| Token | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `aubergine` (page bg) | `#1B1B1F` | Page background — neutral dark gray, recedes |
| `plum` (surface) | `#5E3450` | Letter cells — lifted sakura twilight |
| `mauve` (definition) | `#4A2A40` | Definition cells — medium sakura twilight |
| `bramble` (border) | `#6E3D55` | Borders + grid lines — sakura rule |
| `pitch` (block) | `#0A0A0C` | Inert-cell fill — near-black neutral |
| `petal` (fg) | `#F5EAEC` | Foreground text — warm pink-white |

**Accessibility constraint (WCAG AA) — updated:** `petal` (#F5EAEC, L≈0.843) passes AA on all grid surfaces (on `plum` ~7.4:1, on `mauve` ~9.1:1, on `pitch` ~18.8:1). Brand-colored text on dark backgrounds uses `leaf.400` (#A2D481, ~10:1 on `aubergine`); `leaf.700` falls below AA on `aubergine` and must not be used as text in the twilight theme. Primary button fill uses `leaf.800` (#406038) with `petal` text (~5.6:1, passes AA); `leaf.700` with `petal` is ~4.15:1 and is excluded as a text-over-fill pairing.

#### Amendment (2026-05-08): Role-based token model + theme-swap foundation

The brand-specific primitive names from the prior amendments (`leaf`, `blossom`, `aubergine`, `plum`, `mauve`, `bramble`, `pitch`, `petal`) are replaced by a three-tier role-based token model. **Components no longer reference brand-specific names**; a future palette swap (light theme, alternative brand colours) is now a single-file edit in `panda.config.ts` with zero component touches.

**Tier 1 — Ramps** (in `tokens.colors`):
- `primary.50–900` — brand-coloured ramp (was `leaf`).
- `secondary.50–900` — accent ramp (was `blossom`).
- `neutral.50–900` — surface tonal scale (replaces `aubergine`/`plum`/`mauve`/`bramble`/`pitch`/`petal`). The `.500–.700` stops carry a sakura-rose tint; `.800–.900` (page bg + void) drop the tint to neutral gray per the brand brief.

**Tier 2 — Semantic role tokens** (in `semanticTokens.colors`):

| Role group | Tokens |
|---|---|
| Surfaces | `bg`, `surface`, `surfaceVariant`, `surfaceMuted`, `surfaceElevated` |
| Foreground | `fg`, `fgMuted`, `onAccent`, `onSecondary`, `onSurfaceVariant` |
| Lines | `border`, `gridLine`, `muted` (legacy alias) |
| Brand · primary | `accent`, `accentText`, `accentBg`, `accentHover` |
| Brand · secondary | `secondaryAccent`, `secondaryText`, `secondaryBg` |
| Status | `success`, `successBg`, `successText`, `error`, `errorBg`, `errorText` |
| Focus | `focusRing`, `focusBg` |

Each role maps to a ramp shade in the panda config. The mapping is the only place a theme-swap touches.

**Tier 3 — Components**: reference role tokens (`bg: 'surface'`, `color: 'accent'`) by default. Specific shade access via the renamed ramps (`_hover: { bg: 'primary.800' }`) is allowed for state derivations.

**Status tokens** (`success` / `error`) are now first-class semantic tokens, currently aliased onto the brand ramps (`success → primary.400`, `error → secondary.500`). The `signal` palette reserved earlier in this section can land later by re-mapping just these tokens — no component edit required.

**WCAG AA accountability** stays calibrated against the current twilight palette through the role-token mappings. A future palette swap re-runs the calibration when re-mapping the `accent*`/`onAccent` family.

**Source of truth.** `frontend/panda.config.ts` is the canonical token definition. The hex values in the tables above are historical references showing what the *current* twilight theme resolves to; the names of the role tokens (Tier 2) are stable across themes.

### 5. Typography

Single typeface for v1:

- **Nunito Variable** (Google Fonts, OFL license).
  - Variable axis covers weights 200–1000.
  - Full Latin Extended-A coverage (handles French diacritics including
    `œ`, `ç`, `é`, `à`, `ê`, etc., plus Spanish/Portuguese/etc. for
    future markets).
  - Rounded-sans aesthetic matches the playful direction without being
    childish.
  - Self-hosted via the build pipeline (no Google Fonts CDN call —
    privacy + offline-PWA friendly).

Type scale (mobile-first; desktop scales bump 1.125×):

| Token | Size (rem / mobile) | Weight | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `display` | 2.5 | 800 | Hero / brand wordmark |
| `xl` | 1.875 | 700 | Page titles |
| `lg` | 1.5 | 700 | Section titles |
| `md` | 1.125 | 600 | Subsection / card titles |
| `body` | 1 | 400 | Default body |
| `sm` | 0.875 | 400 | Secondary / labels |
| `xs` | 0.75 | 500 | Captions / metadata |
| `cell` | 1.5 | 700 | Letter-cell content (with `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`) |

A second typeface is **not** introduced in v1. Reasoning: a single face
covers the playful brief, ships in one self-hosted file, and avoids the
"two-font contrast" trap that often makes brands feel busy.

#### Amendment (2026-05-07): Lekton for definition-cell clue text

A second typeface is permitted in **one** narrow surface: the clue text
inside definition cells (`Cell.tsx defText` / `defStackText`).

- **Lekton** (Google Fonts, OFL license, self-hosted via
  `@fontsource/lekton`).
  - Single weight, **700 bold** — clue text reads more distinctly
    against the def-cell background, and stays legible at the small
    `fontSize` values dense grids force. Italic is not loaded.
  - Latin + Latin-Extended-A partitions (~14 KB woff2 total) cover all
    French diacritics (`œ`, `ç`, `é`, `à`, `ê`, etc.).
  - Humanist monospace — every glyph in the loaded ranges has advance
    = 0.5 em (verified against the shipped woff2). Visually less
    "terminal" than fixed-width design fonts; close enough to Nunito's
    proportions to read as the same family at a glance.

**Why the exception.** The offline `scripts/eval/clue_metrics.py` gate
that decides whether each clue is `compact` (eligible for stacked
half-cells, consumed by Kotlin `SkeletonFiller` at grid-generation time)
previously mirrored the browser's Nunito layout in PIL. Every time a
frontend layout constant moved (`lineHeight`, `padding`, ratios, line
wrap behaviour) the gate silently drifted. Lekton's constant glyph
advance lets the gate become a deterministic predicate on `len(clue)`
+ `smart_line_break` + greedy word-wrap — no font-metric measurement,
no PIL dependency, no drift unless the *clue font itself* changes
(captured by a single calibrated constant `LEKTON_ADVANCE_RATIO`).

**Scope.** Letter-input cells, headings, lobby surfaces, the
`CurrentCluePanel`, and the `WordSparrow` wordmark all remain in
Nunito. The exception is strictly the two def-cell text spans.

**Brand integrity.** Two-typeface contrast is normally avoided per the
"busy brand" reasoning above; here the contrast is intentional and
functional — clue text is information-dense, the monospace shift
reads as "this is the puzzle's question, distinct from the answer
field". The single-weight constraint and the OFL self-hosted policy
match Nunito's, so the typographic system stays coherent.

#### Amendment (2026-05-09): Bold (700) button labels

Interactive buttons (`Button` primitive in
`frontend/src/ui/components/primitives/Button.tsx`) set their label
text at weight **700 bold**. This applies to all variants — `primary`,
`secondary`, `ghost` — and supersedes the prior `medium` (500) baseline
that an earlier revision of the primitive shipped with.

- **Why heavier than body.** On the dark twilight palette and at the
  Accueil card density, `medium` (500) reads as "passive label" rather
  than "action". The CTAs in the Accueil mockups (`Reprendre`, `Créer
  une partie`, `Rejoindre`) need to register as primary affordances at
  a glance — bold gets them past the surrounding `fgMuted` body text
  without resorting to color saturation, which would over-warm the
  page.
- **Why not `semibold` (600).** Tested both weights in the dev server
  against the Accueil cards (PR feat/accueil-page); semibold sits too
  close to body weight on Nunito's variable axis to break out of the
  card chrome. Bold is the smallest step that reads as a button label
  at a quick scan.
- **Type-system fit.** The §5 type scale already uses 700 for `xl`,
  `lg`, and `cell` tokens, so 700 is not a new weight in the system —
  buttons join the existing heavy-anchor cohort rather than
  introducing a fresh axis stop.

This supersedes the inline note that previously lived in `Button.tsx`
("brand brief allows weights 400 / 500 only"), which mis-cited this
ADR — the §5 type scale has always used 400 / 500 / 600 / 700 / 800.
The "two-weight rule" referenced there was never an ADR rule.

### 6. Logo: type-only wordmark, designer commission deferred

- **v1 logo:** the word `WordSparrow` set in Nunito Variable at the
  `display` token (2.5 rem mobile / 2.8125 rem desktop), weight 800,
  letter-spacing slightly tightened, color `leaf.700`. The original
  draft used `ink`; in production review the ink wordmark dominated
  the page and made the brand read as "navy", not "green/pink", so
  this amendment moves the wordmark to the brand-primary ramp's
  text-safe shade. `leaf.700` on `cream` is 6.6:1 (passes AA at
  display sizes) and is the same shade §4 already specifies for
  brand-text-on-light-surfaces.

  **Amendment (PR #195, 2026-05-05).** Mobile wordmark collapses to
  `xl` (1.875 rem) on `base` breakpoints to reclaim grid real-estate;
  desktop `2.8125 rem` is unchanged. The `<h1>` element remains in the
  DOM so screen-reader landmark navigation per WCAG 2.4.6 is
  preserved.
- **Wordmark variants:** none in v1. No icon-only mark, no monochrome
  variant, no animated form.
- **Designer commission:** queued for after first 100 paying users (or
  six months, whichever first). The brief will hand the designer this
  ADR plus a usage audit. Until then, the type-only wordmark is the
  canonical mark.

### 7. Language defaults

- **UI primary language:** French (`fr-FR`). The audience is French and
  the puzzle form is French; an English-first UI would be a tone error.
- **UI fallback:** English (`en-US`). All copy is authored in both;
  English is the canonical authoring language with French translations
  reviewed by a native speaker before release.
- **Brand name:** stays English, no localization. `WordSparrow` is
  pronounced and written the same way in any locale.
- **Wordmark `lang` attribute:** the `<html>` root reflects the user's
  detected/selected language; the wordmark element carries
  `lang="en"` so screen readers pronounce it correctly even when the
  surrounding page is French.

### 8. What this ADR explicitly does not decide

- The actual logo design once a designer is engaged.
- Marketing-site copy beyond the in-app wordmark and one tagline (the
  tagline itself is deferred to the implementation workstream's PR
  body, not pinned here).
- Dark mode. Held until justified by user signal.
- Animation / motion language. Held until the first interactive
  feature beyond the static grid lands.
- Iconography system. Held until more than three icons exist on screen
  at once (currently zero).
- Email / transactional design. Held until there are accounts and
  transactional emails to send.
- Sound design / haptics. Held indefinitely; revisit if a competitive
  app makes it table stakes.
- Pricing-page visual design. Held until pricing exists.

## Consequences

### Easier

- A single source of truth for brand decisions: theming PRs, marketing
  copy, deploy ADRs all reference this file instead of relitigating the
  palette / typography / voice each time.
- Implementation workstream is mechanical: take each named token here,
  encode in `panda.config.ts`, propagate through components.
- Repo / Pages-project / Terraform rename is now a single workstream
  with a well-bounded scope ("everything that says Bliss flips to
  WordSparrow") instead of an open-ended audit.
- Future designer commission has a brief: this ADR plus a usage audit.
  No "what does the brand stand for?" round-tripping.

### Harder

- Committing to specific hex values means changing them later requires
  an ADR amendment, not a one-line config change. Acceptable: the
  values were chosen carefully; if we want to change them in three
  months, the amendment cost will tell us whether the change is worth
  it.
- Single-typeface decision means the visual identity has less contrast
  between display and body than a two-typeface system. Mitigation: the
  Nunito variable axis handles weight contrast (800 display vs. 400
  body), which carries enough visual hierarchy for the playful brief.
- French-first UI means English copy can't be the first thing authored;
  every string has to travel through translation. At v1 scale this is
  ~5 strings; manageable. At full-product scale this is a translation
  pipeline (deferred ADR).

### Different

- "Bliss" stops being the public name. Internal docs that reference
  "Bliss" are now historical artifacts and stay as-is for accuracy
  (this ADR doesn't backdate prior ADRs); new docs use "WordSparrow".
- The PWA install banner, browser tab title, mobile home-screen icon
  text all flip to "WordSparrow" once the implementation workstream
  lands. The Cloudflare Pages preview URLs stay until the rename +
  custom-domain workstreams.
- License copyright (`Copyright 2026 ISHO IT EURL`) is unaffected.
  Trademark on "WordSparrow" is its own decision (deferred to a
  separate workstream alongside revenue planning).

## Notes

This ADR is revisited if any of the following occur:

- A user research session shows the playful direction misaligns with
  the actual French *mots fléchés* audience expectations.
- The designer commission produces a logo whose colors clash with the
  palette pinned here. The palette is the constraint; the logo
  conforms, or this ADR is amended.
- A performance budget pushes back on Nunito's variable-font size
  (~75 KB vs. a static-weight subset at ~12 KB). Subsetting is the
  first response, replacement only after.
- A material change to the audience (e.g., expansion to non-French
  markets as primary) breaks the French-first UI assumption.
- Three or more brand-related decisions accumulate as exceptions; per
  manifesto, that triggers a brand-revision review.

Implementation workstreams that follow this ADR (each is its own PR
under the 400-line cap):

1. **`feat/frontend-rebrand-wordsparrow`** — Panda token replacement,
   Nunito Variable self-hosted, `<h1>` and PWA manifest update,
   `index.html` lang/title/favicon, README intro update. Single
   bounded context (`frontend/`), <250 lines hand-written.
2. **`chore/repo-rename-bliss-to-wordsparrow`** — repo rename
   (`Ishou/bliss` → `Ishou/wordsparrow`), Cloudflare Pages project
   rename, Terraform `pages_project_name` default flip, internal
   identifier sweep. Coordinated with the maintainer because the repo
   rename is a GitHub-side click.
3. **`feat/infra-wordsparrow-custom-domain`** — add `wordsparrow.io`
   as a custom domain in `terraform/cloudflare-pages.tf`, document the
   DNS setup at the registrar, update `docs/deploy.md`. Has a manual
   step (DNS records at the registrar) the maintainer applies once.

The order matters: workstream 1 can land independently. Workstream 2
should land before workstream 3 so the custom domain attaches to a
project named `wordsparrow`, not `bliss`.
