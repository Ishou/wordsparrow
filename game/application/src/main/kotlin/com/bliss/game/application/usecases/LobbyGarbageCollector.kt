/**
 * Sweeps lobbies whose `lastActivityAt` is older than the state-specific TTL
 * (ADR-0039 GC matrix). Companion to [CreateLobbyUseCase]'s per-session
 * idempotency: idempotency stops the user-visible "create-on-every-click"
 * path; this GC mops up lobbies that linger after a tab close, network drop,
 * crash, or a finished game whose retention window has elapsed.
 *
 * Decoupled from the WebSocket session manager: instead of polling
 * `SessionManager.connectedCount`, every state-changing use case stamps
 * `Lobby.lastActivityAt`. Consequence: a lobby with active sessions but zero
 * frames within the TTL is still evicted — that is intentional. The frontend's
 * heartbeat / reconnect ping will touch the lobby, and a truly silent client
 * is indistinguishable from an abandoned one.
 *
 * ADR-0039 GC matrix:
 *  - WAITING     → evict after [waitingTtl] (default 24h). Abandoned-lobby cleanup.
 *  - COMPLETED   → evict after [completedTtl] (default 7d). Finished-game retention.
 *  - IN_PROGRESS → NEVER evicted here. Neither query returns IN_PROGRESS rows;
 *                  in-progress lobbies are removed only when the last player leaves
 *                  (see `LeaveLobbyUseCase`).
