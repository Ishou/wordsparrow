/**
 * Returns a session's lobbies as light-weight summaries, ordered by

 * returned — WAITING (un-started) lobbies are excluded because they are
 * "salons d'attente", not "parties". Surfacing them produced confusing
 * 404 toasts when the WAITING TTL evicted them between the list fetch
 * and a rejoin click (ADR-0039 amendment 2026-05-12). WAITING lobbies
 * remain reachable via direct URL / invite code.
 *
 * Filtering lives in the repository so the listing is consistent across
 * adapters and avoids leaking WAITING lobby ids to the client.
 *
 * Pure transform: no events emitted, no clock injection — we deliberately
 * do not bump [Lobby.lastActivityAt] on a read.
