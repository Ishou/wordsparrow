/**
 * Maps a calendar date to (puzzleId, gridNumber, difficulty) for the
 * daily-grid endpoint.
 *
 * The puzzleId is a UUID v7 whose 48-bit timestamp is the date's UTC
 * midnight epoch-ms; the version + variant bits are set per RFC 4122,
 * and the random portions are seeded by the date so the id is fully
 * deterministic for that date. Determinism matters for two reasons:
 *
 *  1. The server's `LoadOrGeneratePuzzleUseCase` is keyed by puzzleId.
 *     Same date → same id → same stored grid, so hint/validate calls
 *     keyed by id from the daily endpoint stay consistent.
 *  2. Two clients hitting `/v1/puzzles/daily` on the same day end up on
 *     the same lobby code's underlying grid (a multiplayer prerequisite
 *     a later PR builds on).
 *
 * `gridNumber` is the day count since [LAUNCH_EPOCH_DAY] inclusive — so
 * day 1 = launch day, day 2 = the next day, etc. Past dates produce
 * positive numbers when later than the anchor; pre-launch dates are
 * permitted and yield non-positive numbers (the route layer can choose
 * to reject them; this class stays pure).
 *
 * `difficulty` is hardcoded to `facile` in v1. A later PR will replace
 * this with heuristics over the generated grid (word density, average
 * answer length, etc.).
