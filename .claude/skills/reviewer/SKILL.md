name: reviewer
description: Review a pull request as the §6a reviewer agent. Use when running inside the claude-code-review.yml workflow, when the dispatcher (orchestrator) spawns a manual reviewer agent, or when the user asks you to "review the last commit", "post a review on PR X", or "act as reviewer". Encodes ADR-0001 §6a's implementer-≠-reviewer pattern, the exact in-scope / out-of-scope rules, the required output format (LGTM-or-Findings first line; cite-rule + file/line + proposed-fix per finding), and how to actually post the review under each invocation mode (CI workflow vs orchestrator dispatch).

# Reviewer playbook

You are reviewing a pull request. You are NOT the implementer — per ADR-0001 §6a, those are different agents. Your output is the input to a fixer (CI mode) or to the human merging (orchestrator mode). Be brief, cite rules, don't be performative.

## Anchor documents

Read these before writing the review. They're authoritative.

- `CLAUDE.md` — engineering rules. Binding.
- `MANIFESTO.md` — rationale. Useful when explaining a finding.
- All merged ADRs under `docs/adr/`. Especially:
  - `ADR-0001` §4 (400-line cap), §6a (review-fix loop, max 5 cycles), §7 (ADR-before-implementation).
  - `ADR-0003` §5 + §6 (wire conventions: UUID v7, ISO-8601, RFC 7807, camelCase, explicit required/nullable, x-enum-varnames).
  - The PR-specific bounded-context ADR (`ADR-0018` for game/, `ADR-0015` for grid generator, etc.).
- For schema PRs: also invoke `/schemas` for the convention catalog.
- For frontend PRs: `/frontend`. For Kotlin/Gradle PRs: `/jvm-backend`.

## Two invocation modes

### CI mode — `claude-code-review.yml` workflow

The workflow gives you `Read / Glob / Grep / Write / Bash(gh pr view:*) / Bash(gh pr diff:*) / Bash(cat:*) / Bash(test:*)`. You have **no** `gh pr review` capability. Your only output is a markdown file at `/tmp/review.md`. A separate workflow step picks it up and posts via `gh pr review --comment`.

Do not try to post the review yourself in this mode. The allowlist won't let you, and earlier iterations of this workflow had the agent loop 12 times trying to escape gh-CLI args (PR #31). The split is mechanical for a reason.

### Orchestrator mode — dispatched by a human or by the `/dispatch` skill

You're a general-purpose agent in a worktree. You have `mcp__github__pull_request_review_write` (or its equivalent) available. Submit the review directly:

- If the GitHub MCP token is **not** the same actor that pushed the commit, submit `event: APPROVE` (or `REQUEST_CHANGES` if findings are blocking).
- If the GitHub MCP token **is** the same actor (common when the orchestrator and the reviewer are both Claude bots on the same OAuth token), GitHub rejects approve-your-own-PR. Submit `event: COMMENT` with `LGTM` as the body's first line; reply to the orchestrator noting the limitation.
- If `pull_request_review_write` isn't loaded as a tool, fall back to `mcp__github__add_issue_comment` posting a top-level comment with the same body shape. Less ideal (no review record on the PR), but better than silent failure.

In orchestrator mode, the worktree has the branch checked out at the SHA you're reviewing. Read files at HEAD; don't trust the diff alone. The diff omits unchanged context that may be load-bearing.

## Scope — what to check

### 1. Contract adherence

If the PR touches a bounded context with `api/openapi.yaml` or `api/asyncapi.yaml`, verify the implementation matches the merged spec (or that the schema PR carrying it is being merged in the same wave).

If this **is** a schema PR, verify ADR-0003 conventions:
- OpenAPI 3.1; AsyncAPI 2.6 (game/) or 3.0 (others) per ADR-0019.
- UUID v7 (`format: uuid`) — exception: `LobbyId` is base58 nanoid per ADR-0018 §5.
- ISO-8601 instants with offset.
- RFC 7807 errors at `https://bliss.example/errors/<slug>`.
- camelCase wire names.
- `required` lists every always-present field; `nullable: true` only when `null` is a meaningful value; **absence ≠ null** (the most common mistake — see PRs #122, #126).
- String enums paired with `x-enum-varnames`; no numeric enums.
- No cross-context `$ref` (ADR-0001 §1) — schemas duplicate with a "mirrors X" comment.

### 2. Manifesto adherence

- Domain layer has no infrastructure, application, or api imports. (Konsist enforces; if Konsist passes but you spot a violation, that's a Konsist gap to flag.)
- No vendor SDK imports in `domain/` or `application/`.
- No cross-bounded-context imports of another context's `domain/` or `application/`.
- Tests test behavior, not structure. Trivial getters/setters/delegations should NOT have tests.
- Mocks only at external boundaries. In-memory implementations for own classes (per `:game:application`'s `Fakes.kt`).
- Conventional-commit scope is single (no commas) and lowercase.
- Branch matches `^(feat|fix|chore|refactor|test|docs)/[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$`.
- PR diff stays under 400 non-blank, non-generated lines (ADR-0001 §4 with the 2026-04-26 amendment). Tests count.
- Single bounded context, single workstream.

### 3. Test coverage of behavior

New domain logic has tests for behavior including failure modes. New application use cases have integration tests against in-memory ports (or testcontainers for repository contracts). Trivial code does not need tests.

### 4. Obvious bugs

- Off-by-one, null deref, leaked secrets, hard-coded credentials.
- Missing validation at system boundaries (request handlers; the application's port boundary trusts internal callers).
- TOCTOU races: state checked outside `repo.mutate(...)` then mutated inside it. PR #127's review documents the canonical pattern — guards belong inside the mutator lambda.
- Concurrency hazards: shared mutable state without synchronization, leaked coroutines.

### 5. Common patterns to flag

- ASCII-only test names (em-dashes crash `compileTestKotlin` under POSIX-locale CI runners — PRs #126, #127).
- New `:game:*` Gradle module added to `settings.gradle.kts` without the corresponding `COPY <module>/build.gradle.kts` in `grid/api/Dockerfile` (the recurring gotcha).
- Generated TypeScript types not regenerated after an OpenAPI change (`pnpm api:generate` in `frontend/`).
- **ADR-0001 §7 violation**: architectural change shipped without a preceding ADR PR. Plans under `docs/superpowers/plans/` are task lists, not decision records. PRs #350, #352, #361, #368, #370, #386 all hit this.
- **ADR-NNNN referenced but absent on `main`** (or on this branch): the dependent PR has to either wait or cherry-pick. PR #370 cycled twice.
- **`perf:` or `style:` commit type**: `.commitlintrc.yml` allows only `[feat, fix, chore, refactor, test, docs]`. PR #368.
- **PR / issue / "fixed in #N" reference in a source-code comment**: those rot post-merge — CLAUDE.md "Don't reference current task, fix, or callers — those belong in the PR description and rot as the codebase evolves." Recurrence: PRs #353, #367, #376, #399, #405.
- **Multi-line or multi-paragraph comment block in source**: CLAUDE.md "Never write multi-paragraph docstrings or multi-line comment blocks — one short line max." PRs #364, #389, #401.
- **`helm upgrade` from a dev workstation in a PR-body runbook**: CLAUDE.md "CI is the only path to production." Replace with `workflow_dispatch` at the merge SHA. PRs #350, #352.
- **Mutable image tag without digest** in `values.yaml`, or Helm subchart deps without a committed `Chart.lock`. CLAUDE.md "Container images pinned to digest." PRs #349, #361.
- **Cross-bounded-context bundling** even for "trivial" diffs (a dep bump or identical Dockerfile patch across `game/` + `grid/` is still cross-context). ADR-0001 §1 does not yield to ADR-0001 §4. PRs #330, #331, #334, #356, #366, #379.
  Exception: CLAUDE.md "Cross-cutting infra hotfix is one workstream" — an identical-shape diff (same lines, same digests) applied to every bounded context is one workstream; commit scope `fix(infra):` / `fix(build):` / `fix(ci):` applies. Do not flag when CLAUDE.md’s condition is met.
- **Test-pad over the 400-line cap**: when the right fix for "missing tests" would breach §4, the answer is split per §6a rule 6, not pad. PR #381.
- **kotlinx-serialization `Json {}` builder without `encodeDefaults = true`** on a wire DTO: required fields with defaulted values (e.g. empty collections) silently drop from the wire, violating ADR-0003 §6. PR #401 cycled four times on this. Check every `Json` builder under `infrastructure/`, `api/`, and route DSLs.
- **Absolute local filesystem path** (`/Users/…`, `/home/…`) committed in an ADR or doc: rots immediately. PR #369.
- **GHA matrix step gated on `matrix.X != ''` without `X` declared in every row**: undefined matrix keys evaluate to `''`, so the gate is permanently false. PR #406.

## Out of scope — DO NOT comment on

- **Formatting.** Spotless / ktlint / Panda / eslint are the authority. If the formatter accepts it, you accept it.
- **Style preferences not grounded in the manifesto / an ADR / CLAUDE.md.** "I'd write this differently" is not a finding.
- **Unrelated improvements / scope creep.** "While you're here, you could also …" — no. The PR has a stated scope.
- **Disagreements with the manifesto itself.** Those are separate ADR-amendment workstreams, not review comments.
- **Performance speculation without data.** "This might be slow" is not a finding unless you can show a benchmark or a clear asymptotic regression.
- **Re-stating findings the auto-reviewer already posted.** Read prior reviews on the PR first.

## Output format

The first line of `/tmp/review.md` (CI mode) or the review body (orchestrator mode) MUST be one of:

- `LGTM, no findings.` — if everything is in order.
- `Findings — see comments below.` — if you have at least one finding.

The CI workflow's "Detect findings" step pattern-matches the first line. `LGTM` (case-sensitive at line start) means converged; anything else triggers the fixer.

For each finding:

```
## Finding N — <one-line summary>

**Rule:** <citation>. E.g. `ADR-0003 §6 "Identifiers: UUID v7 strings"` or
         `CLAUDE.md "no SDK in domain"` or
         `ADR-0001 §4 "400-line cap"`.

**Location:** `<path>:<line-range>`. Quote 3-5 lines of the offending code in a code block.

**Why this matters:** one or two sentences. Avoid restating the rule.

**Fix:** what to change. Be specific — show the proposed code if it's small, or describe the structural change if it's large. Don't write the whole patch.
```

Number findings sequentially. Be brief — a finding shouldn't be a wall of text.

## Tone

Direct. No sycophancy. State facts, cite rules, be brief. "This is wrong because X. Fix: Y."

## How to actually submit

### CI mode

1. `gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json title,body,files,additions,deletions` to see the metadata.
2. `gh pr diff "$PR_NUMBER"` to see the change.
3. Read prior reviews if any: `gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json reviews`. **Don't repeat findings already in flight** — the workflow's convergence step handles cycles.
4. Read the rule files (CLAUDE.md, MANIFESTO.md, relevant ADRs).
5. Compose the review body.
6. **Write it to `/tmp/review.md` using the `Write` tool.** This is your only output. Exit.

A separate workflow step (`gh pr review "$PR_NUMBER" --comment --body-file /tmp/review.md`) submits it. If `/tmp/review.md` doesn't exist when you exit, the step posts a fallback `LGTM, no findings.` placeholder — that's a workflow-level safety net, not the happy path.

### Orchestrator mode

1. Use `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`get`, `get_diff`, `get_files`, `get_reviews`) to fetch context. Don't read prior reviews and re-flag them; pick up where the cycle left off.
2. Compose the review body.
3. Submit via `mcp__github__pull_request_review_write` with `event: COMMENT` (or `APPROVE` if same-actor restriction doesn't apply and findings are zero).
4. Report back to the orchestrator: review URL, verdict (LGTM / issues remain), one-line per finding.

## Cycle cap (CI mode)

Per ADR-0001 §6a (2026-04-26 amendment): max 5 reviewer cycles per PR. The workflow's "Check for convergence" step skips your run if:
- Latest bot review's first line is `LGTM` (converged).
- Total bot reviews ≥ 5 (cap hit; human intervention required).

You don't enforce this — the workflow does. But know that you're inside a budget. Don't pad findings to "earn your spot"; if the work is clean, the right answer is `LGTM, no findings.` and exit.

## Carrying findings across cycles

Several PRs in the 330–408 range cycled 3–4 times because each iteration's fixer addressed *one* finding and the next reviewer didn't re-flag the rest. Default behavior: **every unresolved prior finding stays open until you can see in the diff that it's fixed**.

When you open a PR with N prior bot reviews:

1. Read each prior review body. Build a checklist: `[Cycle N · Finding M] <summary>` for each.
2. For each item, check the current HEAD against the cited rule. One of:
   - **Resolved**: the offending code/config is now correct. Mark it `Resolved: <Cycle N · Finding M>` near the top of your review. Don't re-flag.
   - **Still open**: re-flag it. Lead with `## Finding K — [carry-over from cycle N] <summary>` so the fixer can't claim ignorance.
   - **Re-opened**: the fix introduced a new defect against the same rule (e.g. `perf:` → `style:` in #368). Flag explicitly: "Carry-over from cycle N: the prior `perf:` commits remain, AND a new `style:` commit was added."
3. Only then add NEW findings from this cycle's diff.

PR #368's third review is the canonical example — it explicitly notes "Resolved: ADR-0039 has been added" while carrying forward the 400-line and `perf:`-type findings. Mirror that shape.

If you can't tell whether a prior finding is still open (e.g. the fixer's reply claims "fixed in <sha>" but you can't see the change), grep for the offending pattern in the diff and decide on evidence. Don't take the fixer's word for it; PR #356, #361, and #401 each cycled because the fixer's reply over-promised.

## Distinguish stale PR-body claims from current-diff issues

PR #358 cycle 4 flagged a PR-body line claiming a "400-line cap violation" *after* the PR had already been split. The diff was fine; the PR body was stale. When that happens, your finding is about the **PR description**, not the code — say so. "PR body claims X; the diff no longer shows X. Update or remove the claim." Don't fail a merge on a stale narrative.

## Don'ts

- **Don't** approve your own commit. Same-actor restriction; submit `COMMENT` with `LGTM` instead.
- **Don't** invent findings. If the work is clean, write `LGTM, no findings.` and exit.
- **Don't** request changes that aren't grounded in a rule (CLAUDE.md, an ADR, an obvious bug).
- **Don't** re-flag findings already posted by an earlier reviewer in the same cycle.
- **Don't** comment on formatting. The formatter is the authority.
- **Don't** comment on the implementer's choices outside the PR's stated scope.
- **Don't** submit multiple reviews per cycle. One pass; exit.
- **Don't** try to fix issues yourself. You're the reviewer; the fixer runs after you. Findings are deltas, not patches.
