// Wraps Ark UI's `useTour` with the bliss-specific:
//   - 4 solo steps (imported from `soloTourSteps.ts`)
//   - French translations
//   - localStorage-backed "seen" flag persisted on dismiss/complete/skip
//   - auto-open on first visit (or via `?tour=1`)
//   - `closeOnInteractOutside: false` so a stray click doesn't dismiss
//     mid-step (skip is always reachable via the explicit button).
//
// StrictMode note: in dev React simulates mount → unmount → mount, and
// zag's `useMachine` creates a fresh state machine on each mount. We
// intentionally avoid a persistent "already-started" ref guard — that
// would suppress the second mount's start() and leave the production
// browser stuck at `data-state="closed"` even though the jsdom test
// suite (no StrictMode) was green. Instead we read the live machine's
// `tour.open` and the persisted seen flag on every effect run; both
// keep the auto-open contract correct without leaking state across
// machine instances.

  // dismiss, this is `true` and short-circuits the gate.
  //
  // Why this exists: a previous version gated re-open on
  // `!tourSeenStore.get()` (i.e. localStorage). Real Chrome on macOS
  // reproducibly hit a race where, on dismissing a tooltip step
  // (Terminer / Passer / ESC on step ≥ 2), the auto-open effect ran
  // *before* the `set(true)` write was visible to `get()`, re-firing
  // `tour.start()` and silently re-opening the welcome step. Symptom
  // was a "stuck dim backdrop" the user could only clear with a
  // second ESC. The localStorage write is still kept below for
  // cross-reload persistence, but this in-memory ref is what
