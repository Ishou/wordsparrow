"""Inflect a lemma-form mots-fléchés clue to match a target surface morphology.

Approach:
- Generate clue at the lemma (citation) form: infinitive verb / masc-sing noun
  / masc-sing adjective.
- At lookup time, take the surface form's grammalecte tags, derive the
  inflectional target (mood + person + gender + number, no paradigm prefix),
  find the clue's head token (first content word whose POS matches), and
  inflect it via the morphology index. Other tokens stay verbatim.

This is a deliberately simple first cut — the head-only inflection rule
covers the common crossword patterns ("Aller vite" -> "Vont vite";
"Astre du jour" -> "Astres du jour"; "Couleur du sang" -> stays as-is for
an epicene singular adjective). Multi-token agreement (adjective tracking
its noun's gender, etc.) is left for a v2.
