"""Regression: surface_clues.csv must never ship `no-inflection-finite` rows.

The bug this guards against is the runtime feedback case `tira → "Extraire"`:
  - extraire and soustraire are partially defective in grammalecte (no `ipsi`,
    no `simp`).
  - 16 surfaces of tirer / dérober at those tenses inflated to `no-inflection`
    under the old policy and shipped the lemma-form infinitive — a tense
    disagreement on the live grid.

The fix splits `no-inflection` into a finite-verb sibling (`no-inflection-finite`)
that build_surface_clues drops to `surface_clues_dropped.csv`, reverting the
affected runtime rows to the empty-clue convention.

This test catches the merged-but-not-rebuilt regression: someone hand-edits
surface_clues.csv to re-include a `no-inflection-finite` row, or a future
inflater change reintroduces the lemma fallback for finite tenses.

If this test fires, re-run:
    python scripts/clue_generation/build_surface_clues.py
    python scripts/clue_generation/assemble_corpus.py
